===================

This is the repository for the website for a ['Teaching Software Carpentry'](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/) workshop to be held at UW-Seattle on November 12-14, 2014. The workshop will train people to be instructors of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) [bootcamps](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html). 

The goal of the workshop is to build a community of Software Carpentry instructors on the UW campus so that bootcamps can be offered regularly throughout the university.
