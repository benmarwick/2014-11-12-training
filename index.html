<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
During 12-14 Nov we will be running an on-campus Instructor Training Workshop for people at UW interested in conducting Software Carpentry bootcamps. Our goal is to train local instructors so that we can regularly offer bootcamps on campus to new faculty, staff and students. The workshop covers the basics of educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how researchers can use these ideas to teach other researchers how to use software for data analysis.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> is a volunteer organization whose goal is to make researchers more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching them basic computing skills using free
and open source tools. A bootcamp is an intensive hands-on workshop, run by volunteers and typically two days long, that covers core computational skills needed to be productive as a researcher. Greg Wilson, the founder
of Software Carpentry, will be visiting UW to conduct this workshop.
</p>

<p>
We are inviting participants from all across campus, especially those that use computers to analyse data but don't traditionally identify as computationally intensive (eg. social sciences & humanities). We invite diverse groups of 2-4 people from any UW campus unit (departments, labs, centers, libraries, etc. your group may span more than one unit) who are willing to commit to running a campus bootcamp together after they complete the training. We especially welcome graduate students, post-docs, staff and adjunct faculty to participate.
</p>

<p>
Participants do not need to be expert programmers - in fact, Software Carpentry strongly prefers instructors who are only two steps ahead of their learners and can still remember what it's like to be a novice - but we do expect an enthusiasm for learning and teaching sustainable software skills. For successful applicants all costs of attending the Instructor Training Workshop will be covered by the UW eScience Institute and we will follow up to assist with organising the bootcamps.
